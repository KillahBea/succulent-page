    <h2>I'm So Excited I Wet My Plants</h2>
    <p>Who likes easy plants? This girl! Then maybe don't start with a succulent. Sure they don't require much attention, but too little attention or too much attention will spell certain death. However, a tiny bit of knowledge will lead you down a succulent-filled path. While each variety differs in it's basic likes and dislikes there are a few general rules to follow. 
    <ul>
      <li>Your soil should be well-draining; excessive moisture will likely cause rot and fungus among us.</li>
      <li>Most succulents are light loving and require sunlight; however, the darker the leaf the more shade tolerant the plant.</li>
      <li>Know your seasons! Like bears, succulents "hibernate". You will water your plant babies more often during the growing season and limit their dihydrogen monoxide in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Plants gotta eat, too! Like you, a plant requires nutrients to flourish. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Aloe You Very Much!</h2>
    <p>Another reason I favor succulents is due to the large variety in size, shape and color. Some of my favorites are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>String of Pearls</h4>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/8d/7f/be8d7f8635a78667f4520f5244830e04.jpg" alt= "sting of pearls plant"
        />
        <p>While it is a difficult plant, you will be rewarded by, well what looks like a green string of peas. Apparently someone didn't think "String of Peas" sounded fancy enough. I guess that makes sense when you consider how this elegant lady trails toward the gound.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Lithops</h4>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e1/6c/f4/e16cf436b8c15363fcccfd601b4b3500.jpg" alt= "Lithop plants look like tiny butts"/>
        <p>A small plant that, like many succulents, originates from southern Africa. Most are no larger than 2" tall, they can be quite colorful and resemble rocks. But I like them because I think they look like little butts. Heh.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Cacti</h4>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mixed-display-of-cacti-and-succulents-1523884208.jpg" alt="potted cacti"/>
        <p>Just like all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads; cacti are succulents, too! Everyone should have the experience of planting a cactus friend and getting stuck with their spines. Hint: plain old tape is your best friend to remove those pesky spines.</p>
