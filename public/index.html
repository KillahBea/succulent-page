    <h1>I'm So Excited I Wet My Plants</h1>
    <p>Who likes easy plants? This girl! Then maybe don't start with a succulent. Sure they don't require much attention, but too little attention or too much attention will spell certain death. However, a tiny bit of knowledge will lead you down a succulent-filled path. While each variety differs in it's basic likes and dislikes there are a few general rules to follow. 
    <ul>
      <li>Your soil should be well-draining; excessive moisture will likely cause rot and fungus among us.</li>
      <li>Most succulents are light loving and require sunlight; however, the darker the leaf the more shade tolerant the plant.</li>
      <li>Know your seasons! Like bears, succulents "hibernate". You will water your plant babies more often during the growing season and limit their dihydrogen monoxide in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Plants gotta eat, too! Like you, a plant requires nutrients to flourish. </li>
    </ul>
    <H1>Aloe You Very Much</H1>
    <p>Another reason I favor succulents is due to the large variety in size, shape and color. Some of my favorites are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The String of Pearls, while it is a difficult plant, you will be rewarded by, well what looks like a green string of pearls trailing to the ground.</li>
      <li>Lithops are a small plant that like many succulents originates from southern Africa. Most are no larger than 2" tall, they can be quite colorful and resemble rocks. But I like them because I think they look like little butts. Heh.</li>
      <li>Just like all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads; cacti are succulents, too! Everyone should have the experience of planting a cactus friend and getting stuck with their spines. Hint: plain old tape is your best friend in getting out those pesky spines. </li>
    </ol>
